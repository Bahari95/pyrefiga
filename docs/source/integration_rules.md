# Integration Rules in PyRef IGA

This document specifies the integration (quadrature) rules used in the **pyrefiga** library.

## 📌 Rule 1: Same Quadrature Grid per Parametric Direction

For a given patch, in each parametric direction (ξ, η, ζ), **all operators must be evaluated on the same quadrature grid and with the same weights**, independent of:

- the geometry representation (B-spline, NURBS, etc.)  
- the FE space used for the solution (B-spline, NURBS, or hierarchical splines)

Objects evaluated on the grid include:

- Matrices (mass, stiffness, etc.)  
- Geometry Jacobians  
- Basis functions and derivatives  
- Weak interface terms (e.g., Nitsche enforcement)

🔹 **The quadrature points and weights are independent of the geometry and FE basis.**  
⚠️ The integration grid cannot change during the evaluation of a single operator.

## 🎯 Importance

Using a consistent quadrature grid ensures:

- ✔ Correct evaluation of geometry and FE quantities  
- ✔ Stable and accurate weak enforcement (e.g., Nitsche coupling, DDM)  
- ✔ Optimal convergence rates  (exact quadrature for polynomial basis)

**Additional implementation benefits:**

- 💾 Less memory usage: one grid per direction reused everywhere  
- 🔧 Simpler and safer assembly: no grid conversion or mapping bookkeeping  
- 🚀 Easier extension to multipatch and adaptive refinement: rule applies independently per patch

## 📌 Rule 2: Quadrature Order Depends on Spline Degree

The **minimum quadrature order** should be chosen based on the **maximum degree of the FE solution and the geometry mapping**:  

```text
quadrature_order ≥ max(p_solution, p_geometry) + 1
